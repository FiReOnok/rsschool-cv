## About Me:
I started to get interested in web development at school: started to learn how to create websites, studied html/css.


For my graduation project at _Izhevsk industrial and economic college_ I did a website using **Angular**, **MySQL** and **REST API** (unfortunately I lost the final version of the source code so I didn't include it in **Code examples**).


My goal is to become a Frontend-developer or _maybe_ a Full-stack developer.

## Skills:
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* Git

## Code examples:
```
function multiply(a, b){
  return a * b
}
multiply(2,2);
```

## Experience:
* [Epam frontlab task](https://github.com/FiReOnok/epam_frontlab_task)

## Education:
* _Secondary vocational at_ Izhevsk industrial and economic college (2014-2018)
* _Incomplete higher education at_ Udmurt State University (2020-\...)

## English level:
